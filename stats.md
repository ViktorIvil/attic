# Project Retirements Stats
***

The following graph shows the number of Projects retiring for each year (**NOT** including **Sub-Projects**).

{% assign sorted_years = site.data.years_array |  sort: 'year' -%}
{% assign no_of_years = 20 -%}
{% assign first = sorted_years | size | minus: no_of_years | at_least: 0 -%}
{% assign second = first | plus: 1 -%}
{% assign count_max = 0 -%}
{%- for year in sorted_years offset: first -%}
    {% assign count_max = count_max | at_least: year['p_count'] -%}
{%- endfor %}

```mermaid

    x-axis "Year" [{{ sorted_years[first]['year']}}
     {%- for year in sorted_years offset: second -%}

```

{: .note}
This is currently configured to show the last **{{ no_of_years}} years** of retirements (easily changed through the `$no_of_years` variable).
